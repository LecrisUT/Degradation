Vanilla Rimworld arbitrarily checks each day, each piece of apparel on each pawn, whether it should have it deteriorate by one point.
However, this is not done for weapons and other equipment. This mod rectifies that by doing the same check for them.

An added bonus to that is that weapons used now deteriorates as well. 
Whenever a gun is fired or whenever a melee weapon hits something, a check for deterioration is made.

These percentage values can be changed in the mod settings.
