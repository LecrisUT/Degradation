Do you want things to deteriorate with time and use?
Vanilla Rimworld arbitrarily checks each day, each piece of apparel on each pawn, whether it should have it deteriorate by one point or not.
However, this is not done for weapons and other carried items. This mod rectifies this amongst adding other features.

Features:
-Option to remove vanilla deterioation thus with this mod it's possible to remove all deterioation.
-Possibility to change chance of daily deterioation for equipment, apparell and items in inventory.
-Possibility to increase deterioation damage for equipment, apparell and items in inventory.
-Randomize damage done to equipment, apparell and items in inventory
-Chance of deterioation damage whenever firing a gun.
-Chance of deterioation damage whenever bashing with weapons.
