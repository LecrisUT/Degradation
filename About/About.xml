Do you think it's odd that your clothes
crumbles to dust whilst those berries and
other utilities are safe from those 
harmfull pockets?
That your trusted gun does not break down
whilst being carried?

Then this mod is for you!

This mod makes sure that everything your
pawn carries gets smushed with time!

Special Thanks to: Jecrell and Pardeike

Planned: Modifiable deterioration rate.
